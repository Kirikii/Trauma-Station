  # Roleplay Rule 2 - Escalation is expected

  - You are expected to be able to properly escalate and descalate situations.
  - This means you should use a proper "build-up" when resolving conflict.
  - Try to start with words by talking people out of their actions, move to warnings, only after those are exhausted should you use violence.
  - If someone skips steps, you are welcome to do the same.
  - Antagonists do not have to escalate and can skip right to murder.
  - Not every fight has to go to the death, if someone is trying to run away it isnt a bad idea to let them.
  - Bring people you kill as non-antagonist to medbay for healing unless you have VERY good reason not to.
