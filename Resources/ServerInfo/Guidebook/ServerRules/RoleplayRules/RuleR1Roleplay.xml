  # Core Rule 1 - Roleplay is required

  Treat this game server like DND.

  You are expected as a player to roleplay a character, and to add the the overall story of the round.

  There are a few things to keep in mind:
  - This server is intended to provide a dystopian atmosphere, treat it as such.
  - Try to interact with other players, and put effort into doing so.
  - Antagonists can do as they wish to an extent, and that may involve lots of roleplay, or very little. If an antagonist is killing people with little roleplay, you aren't expected to roleplay further than killing and stopping them.

  ## Examples

  ### [bold] Permitted [/bold]

  - Reacting to police brutality and harsh conditions in ways that could be seen as antagonistic.
  - Playing a unique and creative character.
  - Playing a generic and boring character.

  ### [bold] Not Permitted [/bold]

  - Playing wordlessly without interacting with people.
  - Playing as a character whos sole purpose is to cause issues for others.
  - Self antagonism without purpose "because its what my character would do."
