  # Security

  - Follow space law, it is in your favor.
  - Declare your intent before taking action. Don't just open fire.
  - Do not use contraband as security roles unless there is an immidiate round ending threat (blob, zombies, nukies, or ascended heretic).
  - Beatings are fine if the offender deserves them.
  - Remember to escelate.
  - You are a enforcer for a dystopian company, you can act like it.
  - You may accept bribes, but only to an extent. Examples below.

  ## Bribe Examples
  - Accepting payment for your service weapon is fine.
  - Accepting payment to look the other way is fine.
  - Accepting payment to frame someone is fine.
  - Do not accept payment to kill someone.
  - Do not accept payment to betray security.
  - You cannot "join the syndicate" or simmilar actions.
