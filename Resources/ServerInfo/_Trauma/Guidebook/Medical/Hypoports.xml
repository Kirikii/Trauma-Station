# Hyposprays

On Trauma Station, hyposprays aren't magic and need the target to have a [bold]Hypoport[/bold] surgically installed in their neck to transfer liquids.

You will also need to be [bold]soft-grabbing[/bold] (pulling) the target if you want to inject someone else.

However since they are now more in depth, medical has vial-fed [color=cyan]medical hyposprays[/color] roundstart. The CMO's [color=red]prototype hypospray[/color] holds 50u and can draw from containers directly, keeping it as the superior tool.

Medical hyposprays can be cheaply made and got from any Nanomed Plus vending machine.
They have no internal reservoir, instead feeding from vials like in RMC14.
Very useful to have for patients that have hypoports!

# Hypoports

You can use the detailed health examine button to see if someone has a hypoport installed.

The standard hypoport can be made at a medfab or exofab roundstart and allows anyone with a hypospray to easily inject you with medicines.
This hypoport is what you get for free if you enable the [bold]Hypoport[/bold] trait.

[color=#c96dbf]Science[/color] is able to research [bold]secure hypoports[/bold] which check the user's ID.
The access needed starts out as Medical, but can be changed using a multitool.
When using this remember that if you lose your id, or someone steals it, you won't be able to inject yourself anymore, and they will!
Keep this tradeoff in mind before rushing to replace your standard one.

# Nukies

The team all starts with nukie-locked secure hypoports. As long as nobody loses their IDs, you will be safe from validhunters with hyposprays.

Should you buy reinforcements, even kobolds and monkeys, they won't have hypoports. You can choose to buy a 10TC nukie hypoport for them and install it.

Discuss with your commander and corpsman whether you should extract the hypoport from anyone going undercover, as it could arouse suspicion from astute metagamers.

# Installation

First print or buy a hypoport of choice. Change its access if needed and start operating on the target's head.

The first surgery to do is opening a hypoport cavity. Once you've done that you can install the hypoport separately.

# Hypoports as a traitor

Because not everyone will have a hypoport, you can no longer rely on hypopen with nocturine being a guaranteed KO. As a result it's much cheaper (and you can just get a regular hypo anyway)

If you are a traitor with a hypoport you can use it to easily heal yourself on the go. If you change a secure hypoport's access to Syndicate, an Agent ID will allow you alone to use it.
Very handy if the doctors are carrying poisons on them, "just in case".
